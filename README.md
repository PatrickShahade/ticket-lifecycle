<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

<p>
1) Let's take a look at how ticket life starts. This is the HelpDesk from an End User's point of view. I'll "Open a New Ticket" as a User I created in the post-install configuration. I'm just having fun with the details, but you can see how this would go. I'll create this ticket and see what it looks like on the other side!

2) From the agent side I'm going to log in as Jane and take a look at the newly created ticket. There it is right there! If I click on the ticket I can see what sort of details it holds. I'm going to need to assign this to someone and set an SLA, but it seems Jane doesn't have the permissions. I'll try to see this again as John.

3) John can update the SLA and assign an agent. I'll give it to Jane and set the SLA to our most urgent status. It's possible to assign this ticket to a specific team, or even ourselves if we wanted to, but I'm just going to assume John wanted to assign this to Jane.

4) On Jane's side, she can see an updated ticket that has comments and internal notes on it. She can make a response here that our End User can see and "resolve" the issue. Tickets are as complex as the people who create them, and may need to be reassigned to different Agents or Teams until they are resolved. With our demo problem, it's just as simple as giving information to the User to help them along.

5) Real quick, let's just take a look from the Admin side and see how this ticket was handled after it was closed. You can see the ticket Jane just completed. We can see the whole lifecycle of that ticket and we can even continue to add replies or notes. If we wanted we could reopen or change the status of some tickets.

This is the most basic overview of the ticket lifecycle.
